###  Project Problem Definition:
Content creators, such as YouTubers, often struggle to create engaging and clickable thumbnails that effectively increase their click-through rates (CTR).
Additionally, the process of labeling large datasets of images for machine learning projects is time-consuming and costly.
There is a need for a platform that can efficiently crowdsource these tasks while providing a fair compensation mechanism for the workers involved.

### Problem Objective: The objective is to develop a platform where users can crowdsource image labeling and thumbnail optimization tasks. 
Helpers can post images for labeling, and YouTubers can post thumbnails to be rated for clickability. Taskers across the world can participate in these tasks and receive micropayments through the Solana blockchain.
The platform will also offer an AI-generated thumbnail service, which creates engaging thumbnails based on the video content.

### Phase 1- AI Image generation:
Completed phase 1 by use of Gemini API to summarize youtube videos and use of freepik api to generate thumbnails
